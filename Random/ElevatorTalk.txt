I started working professionally in the hospitality industry where I learned quick decision making, analytic problem solving, and how to flourish in a fast-paced environment. Most recently I was hired as a part of the management team at Blue Plate Restaurant Company where I coached a team of 30 employees on proper food handling procedures, proper food preparation, and execution, and taught them high-level time management skills look like. I understand you are looking to hire someone who is reliable and can pick up on the ever-growing technology used at this company, I have spent the last 6 months working in an extremally accelerated Cloud DevOps Engineering program where I received my AWS Certified Developer associate in just 6 short weeks. I thrive in fast-paced environments, learn extremally quickly, and thrive to coach others to provide a successful team.
