I started working professionally in the hospitality industry where I learned quick decision making,
analytic problem solving, and how to flourish in a fast paced enviorment. Most recently I was hired
as a part of the management team at Blue Plate Resturant Company where I lead a team of 30 employees
and coached them on proper food handling procedures, proper food preperation and excecution, and 
taught them what high level time management skills look like. I understand you are looking to hire 
someone who is reliable and can pick up on the ever growing technology used at this company, I have 
spent the last 6 months working in an extremly accelerated Cloud DevOps Engineering program where I 
recieved my AWS Certified Developer assoiciate in just 6 short weeks. I thrive in fast paced 
enviormments, learn extremly quick, and thrive to coach others to provide a successful team.
